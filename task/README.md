# Task Folder - Comprehensive Testing & Code Review

This folder contains comprehensive testing infrastructure and performance analysis for the EduSphere Backend application.

## Structure

- **unit-tests/**: Individual service and controller unit tests
- **integration-tests/**: Cross-service integration tests  
- **performance-tests/**: Time and space complexity analysis
- **utils/**: Testing utilities, mocks, and helpers
- **benchmarks/**: Performance benchmarks and metrics
- **reports/**: Test coverage and performance reports

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all task tests
npm run test:task

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Performance Considerations

All tests include analysis of:
- Time complexity (Big O notation)
- Space complexity 
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage patterns
- Response time benchmarks

## Test Coverage Goals

- 100% unit test coverage for all services
- Integration test coverage for all API endpoints
- Performance benchmarks for all database operations
- Error handling validation for all edge cases
