## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Background
Edusphere addresses the challenges faced by Ghanaian students (ages 15‚Äì30) in accessing timely academic support and collaborative learning opportunities. Traditional learning methods often lack real-time interaction and personalized assistance, while existing digital platforms may be fragmented or lack advanced features like AI support. Edusphere aims to bridge these gaps by providing a unified platform that integrates discussion rooms, AI-driven query responses, and multimedia sharing, tailored to the needs of students and educators in Ghana.

### 1.2 Mission
To empower Ghanaian students by delivering a dynamic platform that facilitates collaborative learning, provides real-time AI-powered academic support, and supports multimedia content sharing to enhance educational outcomes.

### 1.3 Objectives
- **General Objective**: Develop a scalable backend to support collaborative learning and AI-driven assistance for an engaging educational experience.
- **Specific Objectives**:
  - Implement RESTful APIs for user management, discussion rooms, and multimedia handling.
  - Integrate real-time messaging using WebSockets for discussion rooms.
  - Enable AI-driven query processing for academic support.
  - Ensure data security with industry-standard encryption and authentication.

### 1.4 Target Audience
- **Primary Users**: Ghanaian students (high school, university, and professional learners).
- **Secondary Users**: Educators facilitating discussions or providing resources.
- **Demographics**: Ages 15‚Äì30, with access to internet-enabled devices, primarily in Ghana.

## 2. Core Features
The Edusphere Backend supports the following core features:
- **Discussion Rooms**: Real-time chat rooms for collaborative learning and peer discussions.
- **AI Assistant**: Instant, personalized academic support using NLP-driven query responses.
- **Multimedia Library**: Upload and share images/videos to enhance educational content.
- **User Profiles**: Manage personal details, preferences, and activity history securely.
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based login and registration with encrypted data protection.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overview
The Edusphere Backend follows a modular, layered architecture built with NestJS and Node.js, using PostgreSQL for data persistence. It integrates with a React frontend via REST APIs and WebSockets, and supports AI query processing through NLP libraries.

### 3.2 Components
- **API Gateway**: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate controllers.
- **Modules**:
  - **Auth Module**: Manages user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
  - **Rooms Module**: Handles creation, management, and messaging for discussion rooms.
  - **AI Module**: Processes academic queries using NLP libraries (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy).
  - **Media Module**: Manages upload, storage, and retrieval of images and videos.
  - **Users Module**: Manages user profiles, preferences, and activity history.
- **WebSocket Gateway**: Enables real-time messaging for discussion rooms using Socket.IO.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM for structured data storage.
- **External Integrations**: Optional integration with external NLP APIs for advanced AI functionality.

### 3.3 Data Flow
- **HTTP Requests**: The frontend sends REST API requests (e.g., `POST /auth/login`) to the API Gateway, which routes to controllers and services.
- **WebSocket Events**: Real-time chat messages are broadcast via the WebSocket Gateway to connected clients.
- **Database Interactions**: Services use TypeORM to perform CRUD operations on PostgreSQL.
- **AI Processing**: The AI Module processes user queries and returns responses, either locally or via external APIs.
- **Security**: All data transmissions use HTTPS, with sensitive data (e.g., passwords) encrypted using AES-256.

### 3.4 Scalability Considerations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL supports scaling to thousands of users with indexing and partitioning.
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for caching frequent queries (e.g., room messages) to reduce database load.
- **Load Balancing**: Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Render) with load balancers for high traffic.
- **AI Optimization**: Offload complex NLP processing to dedicated servers or APIs if needed.

## 4. Data Model

### 4.1 Entities
The backend uses a normalized PostgreSQL database with the following entities:
- **User**:
  - Attributes: id (Primary Key, Integer), username (String, Unique), email (String, Unique), password (String, Hashed), created_at (Timestamp).
  - Purpose: Stores user account details and authentication data.
- **Room**:
  - Attributes: id (Primary Key, Integer), name (String), creator_id (Foreign Key, References User.id), created_at (Timestamp).
  - Purpose: Represents discussion rooms for collaborative learning.
- **Message**:
  - Attributes: id (Primary Key, Integer), room_id (Foreign Key, References Room.id), user_id (Foreign Key, References User.id), content (Text), sent_at (Timestamp).
  - Purpose: Stores chat messages within discussion rooms.
- **Media**:
  - Attributes: id (Primary Key, Integer), room_id (Foreign Key, References Room.id), user_id (Foreign Key, References User.id), file_path (String), file_type (String, e.g., ‚Äòimage‚Äô, ‚Äòvideo‚Äô), uploaded_at (Timestamp).
  - Purpose: Manages uploaded images and videos.
- **AIQuery**:
  - Attributes: id (Primary Key, Integer), user_id (Foreign Key, References User.id), query (Text), response (Text), created_at (Timestamp).
  - Purpose: Tracks user queries and AI-generated responses.

### 4.2 Relationships
- **One-to-Many**:
  - User to Room: One user can create multiple rooms.
  - Room to Message: One room contains multiple messages.
  - Room to Media: One room contains multiple media files.
  - User to Message: One user sends multiple messages.
  - User to Media: One user uploads multiple media files.
  - User to AIQuery: One user submits multiple AI queries.
- **Constraints**:
  - Unique constraints on User.username and User.email.
  - Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity (e.g., room_id in Message references Room.id).
  - Cascade deletes for Messages and Media when a Room is deleted.

### 4.3 Normalization
The schema is normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.
